This is the personal blog of Andrew R. McCluskey, he is a Lecturer in Chemistry and Scientific Computing at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk), where he leads the [SCAMs@bristol](https://scams-research.github.io) research group.
Originally from [Glasgow](https://goo.gl/maps/uqEbSEupr8jSi6Qn7), he now lives in [Bristol](https://goo.gl/maps/476YLFRjRMtga9jH9).

If not in the office he will likely be found running up and down muddy hills. 

## Where to find Andrew

Andrew is in office XXX in the [School of Chemistry](https://goo.gl/maps/f9JrPsB4EbG18Xek6) in the Tyndalls Park area of the city. 
However, he frequently spends time at the [Rutherford Appleton Laboratory](https://goo.gl/maps/DrnXpGWfEF9mspjq5) near Didcot, so it is best to drop him an email.
