Over the past year, with COVID restrictions reducing, I have found myself with a lot of work-related travel. 
In the interest of being more environmentally conscious, and due to the fact that I am not living in mainland European[^1], I have elected to use the train as much as possible. 
This has resulted in many entire days of train travel, and some multiple days. 
For a long time, I have preferred the train to the plane, planes have made me anxious for a long time and the ease of train travel cannot be beat. 
However, I have found an additional benefit to my new preferred method of travel, which I feel other “knowledge workers” (to borrow a phrase I don’t like from Cal Newport’s [Deep Work](https://mccluskey.scot/2022/12/21/thoughts-on-deep-work.html)) may also experience.
