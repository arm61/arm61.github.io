In 2022, with COVID restrictions reducing, I found myself with a lot more work-travel travel. 
In the interest of being more environmentally conscious, and due to the fact that I am now living in mainland Europe[^1], I decided to use the train as much as possible. 
There is also selfish reasons, of course, I enjoy train-travel and have an interest in railways.

The result of this "year of trains"[^2] is that I enjoyed many days, and sometimes multiple days, travelling by train to different parts of Europe. 
And in additional to the ease of train travel, I have found an additional benefit, which I feel other "knowledge workers" (to borrow a phrase I don’t like from Cal Newport’s [Deep Work](https://mccluskey.scot/2022/12/21/thoughts-on-deep-work.html)) may be interested in. 
This is trains as a *Deep Work space*. 



I hope that this will give others a different perspective on train-travel for work purposes and inspire others to travel more by this more climate-friendly approach.

Specifically focusing on productivity
