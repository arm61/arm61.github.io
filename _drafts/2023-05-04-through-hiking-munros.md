At the start of May, I found myself back in Scotland for the first time in about 18 months. 
I was in the UK for beamtime at the ISIS Neutron and Muon Source, but took a detour to visit family in the north and get some [Munros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munro) in.

This was my first attempt at *light* camping[^1].
As a younger man, I had completed the [West Highland Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Highland_Way) and [Great Glen Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Glen_Way) carrying my tent and food supplied throughout, but this was the first time I would be climbing Munros with this equipment. 
I had the following gear:
- bivvy bag
- sleeping bag
- ultralight mat
- tarp (in the end, this wasn't necessary cause of good weather)
- camping stove and food
- clothes, etc.

In my pack, it probably weighed 15 kg (which was heavily than I liked), and in future, I would take less "etc".

My day started from Glasgow, catching an early morning train to [Corrour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrour_railway_station). 
Corrour station had been of interest to me for a long time; it is the highest station on the British mainline, it is one of a few stations that is not accessible by car and I grew up on [Corrour Road](https://goo.gl/maps/MQwS2epwVQ98ausS7) in Glasgow's Southside. 
At Corrour, I started [walking west](https://www.strava.com/activities/8991749335), with the goal of reaching the forest north of Kinlochleven by around 5 pm. 

The area around Corrour is rather marshy, so even with the nice weather, the ground was damp underfoot. 
I followed the path through the marsh, getting lost every few hours, until I found myself on the wrong side of the Abhainn Rath. 
Luckily, the water level was low enough that wading across carrying my boots and socks was feasible. 

Aside from this, the day was rather uneventful.
The goal was to reach a suitable starting places for Munro bagging the following day. 
However, with nowhere suitable to wild camp in the hills north of Kinlochleven, I decided to visit my favourite village in Scotland, enjoy a pint, and get an early night in the MacDonald hotel campsite. 

[^1]: I don't think I can claim it to be ultralight but it is a step in that direction.
