Recently, I have been rewatching the Damon Lindelof TV show [The Leftovers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Leftovers_(TV_series))[^1], which I admit I didn’t finish the first time round (so no spoilers, please).
In the light of a “post-COVID” world, parts of this show being to feel prophetic. 
The scare quotes reflect the uncertainty many still feel,but here in Denmark we are definitely [post-COVID](https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/indland/ordfoerere-glaeder-sig-over-aendret-coronakurs-ingen-oensker-nye-restriktioner). 

For those unfamiliar, The Leftovers is set in the aftermath of “the departure”, where 2% of the world’s population suddenly disappear.
The subject of the show is not **why** these people disappeared, instead looking at the effect on those *left behind*.
A new departure-related industry emerges, cult membership booms, and dogs revert to being wild beasts. 
But for many, *life goes on*. 

In [S02E04](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4550146/), “the departure” is referred to as “the greatest scapegoat in all of civilisation”. 
Of course the scales are different (the current death toll from COVID is around 20% of the number that are departed) and the causeless nature of the departure mean that The Leftovers expresses an extreme version of this. 
However, this is one of the strongest parallels between the reaction to these world-changing events. 

We are currently facing [cost of living crises]() across European, which are played by many as a direct result of COVID, overlooking decades of runaway Capitalism. 
Globally there are supply chain problems, inflating prices and increasing wait times, where we ignore the influence of the developed world propping up dictators that sustained the growth of sweatshops. 
Finally, the current Conservative government in the UK, is in the process of convincing the populous of the exclusive role that COVID has played in the imminent collapse of the [National Health Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service), and not more than a decade of active dismantling through underfunding[^2]. 

The *crazy* reactions that we see in The Leftovers will always have had parallels in the real world. 
At the start of the pandemic, I (naïvely) hoped that should we make it through this we would live in a more caring world. 
I hoped that a [universal basic income]() would remove the need for worries about government supported furlough. 
The reduction of the pandemic to its effect on GDP tells me that I was being too optimistic.
