I am rewatching the Damon Lindelof TV show [The Leftovers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Leftovers_(TV_series))[^1], which I admit I didn’t finish the first time round (so no spoilers). 
Rewatching in a “post-COVID” world, the show seems prophetic. 
I put “post-COVID” in scare quotes to reflect the uncertainty still felt by many, but here in Denmark we are definitely [post-COVID](https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/indland/ordfoerere-glaeder-sig-over-aendret-coronakurs-ingen-oensker-nye-restriktioner). 


[^1] And becoming convinced it is the best TV show ever.
