The subject of "[deep work](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/)" resonates with me, I have a habit of getting *stuck* in a problem. 
This is where a particular topic of work can become all-encompassing, and I find myself accidentally working until late in the evening or over a weekend[^1].
While sometimes this is a good thing that results in sprints of productivity, it introduces problems when I want to switch off at the end of the day and spend time with my partner or friends. 

I hadn't previously considered this trait of an obsessive brain as a practice before. 
However, I was curious if treating this process as a practice, one that is activated and deactivated, I would become better at switching off and be able to perform focused work on topics that I don't find as *interesting*.
In this post, I want to document some of the ideas that I liked from [Cal Newport](https://www.calnewport.com/)'s book on the subject and discuss how I will integrate them into my practice. 

## Work Blocks

Early in the book, Newport writes about Adam Grant, a high-flying business professor at the University of Pennsylvania. 
Grant blocks the projects that he works on based on the time of year, working on teaching things in the autumn and focusing instead on research the rest of the year. 
In work, I typically have five or six projects on the go at any time, I have found myself working on one of them for an extended period and then neglecting it for a long stretch as I work on other things. 
In many ways, I am practising this blocking of work already. 
However, in the interest of being more deliberate with the practice of deep work, I have decided to work on projects a week at a time, changing each week and deciding the order well in advance. 

**Work on projects for a minimum unit of one week and decide which project is assigned to each week well in advance.**

## Shutdown Ritual

Newport advocates for a *shutdown ritual* that comes at the end of a period of deep work. 
The concept of this is that there is a procedure associated with stopping deep work, this procedure will ensure that the work is documented and help to turn off the part of your brain that might still be thinking about a particular aspect. 
This idea sounds very valuable if you can get it to work. 

**Implementing a shutdown ritual which documents the next steps for the project.**

## Planning Every Minute

Planning every minute means at the start of a given workday, making a plan for how you will spend each minute of that day and writing this down. 
There is still the flexibility to deviate from this plan but unless there is a good reason this plan should be followed. 
I want to test this practice out, though my main worry is with sticking to a given schedule (if for example a task takes longer than anticipated).

**Make a plan for each day.**

## Communication Isolation

Newport suggests that one should make themselves hard to reach by email, as a route to performing less "shallow work" (the arch enemy of "deep work"). 
This includes not replying if:

> Nothing really good would happen if you did respond and nothing really bad would happen if you didn't.

I rather dislike this language, which suggests one's need to perform "deep work" is more important than anyone else's. 
What if a colleague emails with an important question and a reply to that email would de-block their "deep work"?
I expect that the statement intends that you should be able to tell when this would be the cause but it (1) assumes everyone follows the email practice that Newport outlines in the book and (2) strikes a very pompous tone. 

**Try and be a good/kind email user, but limit the usage to a given period at the start of the day.**

## On Focus

Reading this book has made me think about how I focus on work.
I admit to being rather bipolar with focus; sometimes completely in the zone and other times, completely distracted. 
I want to be a more focused, deliberate person, and to this end, I am making a conscious effort to focus on things, both at work and home.
I hope that this will help me pay more attention to the TV shows and films that I watch instead of looking at my phone. 

**Focus.**
