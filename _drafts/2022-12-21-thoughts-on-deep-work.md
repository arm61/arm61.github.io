The subject of "[deep work](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/)" resonates with me, I have a habit of getting *stuck* in a problem. 
This is where a particular topic of work can become all encompassing, and I find myself accidently working until late in the evening or over a weekend[^1].
While sometimes this is a good thing that results in sprints of productive, it introduces problems when I want to switch off at the end of the day and spend time with my partner or friends. 

I hadn't previously considered this trait of an obsessive brain as a practice before. 
However, I was curious if treating this process as a practice, one that be activated and deactivated, I would become better at switching off and be able to perform focused work on topics that I don't find as *interesting*.
In this post, I want to document some of the ideas that I liked from [Cal Newport](https://www.calnewport.com/)'s book on the subject and discuss how I will integrate them in my practice. 






What I liked:
- The idea of treating deep work as a practice, in particular setting time to focus and time to switch off 
- The concept of a *shutdown ritual*, to end the day with planning what will happen the next day 
- Setting aside "sprints" for work, this isn't an explicit concept in the book but is alludes to this

What I didn't like:
- Some of the suggestions regarding ignoring, in particular email, strike me as pompous - why is your work more important than the work of someone that might need your help

What will I do: 

- Working on being more delibrately focused, in all aspects (watching films at home)
