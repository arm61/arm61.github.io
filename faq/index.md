**Q**: Why the viking ship?<br>
**A**: It is a cool logo that I made a few years ago and I wanted to use it somewhere. 

**Q**: I heard you are colourblind, what colours should I use for my graph?<br>
**A**: I like to use the [seaborn colorblind palette](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/blob/d25872b0fc99dbf7e666a91f59bd4ed125186aa1/seaborn/palettes.py#L43) with the following names given when referring to them in the text: <font color="#0173B2">blue</font>, <font color="#029E73">green</font>, <font color="#D55E00">orange</font>, <font color="#CC78BC">pink</font>, <font color="#ECE133">yellow</font>, <font color="#56B4E9">light blue</font>. 

**Q**: I am working in a forked Github repository, how to I catch the fork up with the `upstream`?<br>
**A**: First, make sure that the `upstream` is [configured](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/configuring-a-remote-repository-for-a-fork) and then the forked branch can be [synced](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork#syncing-a-fork-branch-from-the-command-line).
